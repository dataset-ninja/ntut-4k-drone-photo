**NTUT 4K Drone Photo Dataset for Human Detection** is a dataset for object detection and identification tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the drone inspection domain. 

The dataset consists of 4095 images with 50553 labeled objects belonging to 12 different classes including *walk*, *recognizable*, *stand*, and other: *riding*, *sit*, *block50*, *block25*, *push*, *block75*, *watchphone*, *baseball*, and *soccer*.

Images in the NTUT 4K Drone Photo dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 26 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2156 images) and *test* (1939 images). Additionally, every *recognizable* class has its own ***id*** tag. The dataset was released in 2022 by the Taipei Tech AIoT Lab, Taiwan.
